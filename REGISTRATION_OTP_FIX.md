# 🔧 Registration & OTP Issue - FIXED

## ❌ Problem
When creating an account:
- Error: "User profile not found in Firestore. Signing out..."
- OTP was not being sent
- User was signed out immediately after registration
- OTP verification screen not showing

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `onAuthStateChanged` listener in `AuthContext.jsx` was interfering with the registration flow:

1. User registers → Firebase Auth account created
2. User profile created in Firestore with `emailVerified: false`
3. User signed out to show OTP screen (intentional)
4. **BUG**: Auth listener detected sign-out and cleared all state
5. This prevented the OTP screen from showing and interrupted email sending

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed Auth State Listener** (`Frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`)

**Changed lines 36-46:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
if (!currentUser) {
  setUser(null);
  setPartner(null);
  setLoading(false);
  return;
}

// AFTER (FIXED)
if (!currentUser) {
  // Don't clear state if user is in verification process
  if (!isVerifying) {
    setUser(null);
    setPartner(null);
  }
  setLoading(false);
  return;
}
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- The `isVerifying` flag is set to `true` during registration
- When user is signed out for OTP verification, the auth listener checks this flag
- If `isVerifying` is true, it doesn't clear the state
- This allows the Register component to show the OTP screen

### 2. **Updated Dependency Array**

**Changed line 100:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
}, []);

// AFTER
}, [isVerifying]); // Add isVerifying to dependency array
```

**Why this matters:**
- Makes the effect re-run when `isVerifying` changes
- Ensures the auth listener respects the verification state

### 3. **Enhanced Error Logging**

Added detailed console logs to help debug email sending issues:
```javascript
console.log('📧 Request payload:', { email, otp, name });
console.log('📧 Response status:', response.status, response.statusText);
console.log('📧 Response body:', result);
```

## 🎯 Registration Flow (After Fix)

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **User fills registration form** → Clicks "Register"
2. **Firebase Auth account created** → UID generated
3. **6-digit OTP generated** → e.g., "123456"
4. **OTP stored in Firestore** → `otpCodes/{uid}` collection
5. **Backend API called** → `POST /api/otp/send`
6. **Email sent via Nodemailer** → Using Gmail SMTP
7. **User profile created** → With `emailVerified: false`
8. **UID stored in sessionStorage** → Key: `pending_verification_uid_{email}`
9. **isVerifying flag set to TRUE** → Prevents state clearing
10. **User signed out** → To show OTP screen
11. **Register component switches to step 2** → OTP input screen shows
12. **User receives email** → With 6-digit OTP
13. **User enters OTP** → Verification process starts

### Step 2: OTP Verification

14. **OTP validated** → Against Firestore document
15. **User signed in** → Using email & password
16. **Profile updated** → `emailVerified: true`
17. **isVerifying flag set to FALSE** → Normal auth flow resumes
18. **Redirect to dashboard** → User logged in successfully

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Check Backend is Running
```powershell
# Open terminal and run:
cd Backend
npm start

# Should see:
# ✅ Server running on port 5000
# ✅ Connected to Firebase
```

### Test 2: Register New Account
1. Open browser → `http://localhost:5174` (or your Vite port)
2. Click "Get Started" → Fill registration form
3. **Check browser console** → Should see:
   ```
   🔵 STEP 1: Form submitted!
   🔵 STEP 2: Calling register function...
   📧 Sending OTP to backend: http://localhost:5000
   📧 Request payload: {email: "...", otp: "123456", name: "..."}
   📧 Response status: 200 OK
   ✅ OTP email sent successfully to: your@email.com
   🔵 STEP 3: Register result: {success: true, ...}
   🔵 STEP 4: Switching to OTP screen...
   🟢 STEP 5: Step is now 2 - OTP screen should show!
   ```

4. **Check email inbox** → You should receive OTP email
5. **OTP screen should be visible** → 6 input boxes for OTP
6. Enter OTP → Click "Verify"
7. Should redirect to dashboard

### Test 3: Verify No More Errors
**Browser console should NOT show:**
- ❌ "User profile not found in Firestore. Signing out..."
- ❌ "Auth state changed: No user"

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Network error" or "Failed to send OTP"

**Check 1: Backend is running**
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
# Should show: LISTENING
```

**Check 2: Email credentials in Backend/.env**
```powershell
cd Backend
Get-Content .env | Select-String "EMAIL"
# Should show:
# EMAIL_USER=partnermyapp2025@gmail.com
# EMAIL_PASSWORD=kxtgacigeqtpcsoe
```

**Fix: Start backend**
```powershell
cd Backend
npm start
```

### Issue: OTP screen not showing

**Check: Browser console for step logs**
```
Should see: 🔵 STEP 4: Switching to OTP screen...
Should see: 🟢 STEP 5: Step is now 2 - OTP screen should show!
```

**If steps stop at STEP 3:**
- Registration failed
- Check console for error message
- Try again with different email

### Issue: Email not received

**Check 1: Spam/Junk folder**
- Gmail often marks automated emails as spam
- Check "Promotions" tab in Gmail

**Check 2: Backend logs**
```powershell
# In Backend terminal, should see:
✅ OTP email sent to: your@email.com
```

**Check 3: Email service credentials**
- Make sure `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are correct in Backend/.env
- App password should be: `kxtgacigeqtpcsoe`

### Issue: "Invalid OTP" error

**Check: Email has correct OTP**
- OTP is 6 digits
- OTP expires in 10 minutes
- Each OTP can only be used once

**Fix: Request new OTP**
- Click "Resend OTP" button
- Check email for new code
- Enter new OTP within 10 minutes

## 📋 Files Changed
